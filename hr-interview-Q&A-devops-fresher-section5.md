## 💰 SECTION 5: Salary & Commitment

### 2️⃣ Are you open to the salary offered?

Yes, I am open to the salary offered if it aligns with industry standards and the learning opportunities provided.

### 3️⃣ Do you have other offers?

Currently, my priority is finding the right organization where I can build my DevOps career with strong technical exposure and long-term growth.
