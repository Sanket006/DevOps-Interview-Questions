# 🎯 VERSION A – Primary DevOps Engineer (Solo with Oversight)

---

## 1️⃣ “Tell me about your project and your role”

### Answer (say exactly this):

“I worked on an enterprise e-commerce platform called ApnaKart for a client, Nova Technologies. The system was built using a microservices architecture on AWS and Kubernetes.

I worked as the primary DevOps engineer, responsible for CI/CD automation, infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, Kubernetes deployments, and monitoring.

Since I was a fresher, all architectural decisions, security configurations, and production releases were reviewed and approved by senior architects and the project manager, which ensured production safety while allowing me to take hands-on ownership.”

---

## 2️⃣ “Isn’t it risky to have only one DevOps engineer?”

### Answer:

“It would be risky if the system was manual. To reduce risk, we heavily relied on Infrastructure as Code, approval-based CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes auto-healing.

No changes were made directly in production. All deployments went through Jenkins pipelines, code reviews, and approvals, so operational risk was controlled.”

---

## 3️⃣ “What were your daily DevOps responsibilities?”

### Answer:

“My daily work involved monitoring pipeline health, supporting deployments, managing Kubernetes resources, handling alerts from Datadog, and collaborating with developers and QA teams to ensure smooth releases.

I also worked on optimizing pipelines, improving deployment speed, and documenting procedures.”

---

## 4️⃣ “What would you do if production goes down?”

### Answer:

“First, I would identify the scope of impact using monitoring dashboards and logs.

I’d check Kubernetes pod health, recent deployments, and resource metrics. If required, I’d rollback using the CI/CD pipeline.

For critical issues, I’d immediately escalate to senior engineers and follow the incident response process.”

---

## 5️⃣ “What did you learn as a fresher working this way?”

### Answer:

“I learned how enterprise DevOps teams manage risk through automation, reviews, and standard processes.

It helped me build confidence in working with AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD while understanding the importance of controlled production environments.”

# 🔁 VERSION B – DevOps Team (2–3 Engineers)

---

## 1️⃣ “Tell me about your project and your role”

### Answer (say exactly this):

“I worked on an enterprise e-commerce platform called ApnaKart for a client, Nova Technologies. The application was built using microservices and deployed on AWS EKS.

We had a 3-member DevOps team, and I worked as a DevOps Engineer mainly responsible for CI/CD pipelines, Dockerization, and Kubernetes deployments.

Infrastructure and production reliability were handled collaboratively by the team.”

---

## 2️⃣ “What was your contribution in the DevOps team?”

### Answer:

“My main contribution was building and maintaining Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, integrating GitHub, Maven, SonarQube, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I also worked on deploying microservices to EKS, configuring Kubernetes resources, and supporting releases.”

---

## 3️⃣ “Who handled production incidents?”

### Answer:

“Production incidents were handled by the DevOps team collaboratively.

Based on the issue, one engineer would take the lead, while others supported with debugging, rollbacks, or infrastructure fixes.”

---

## 4️⃣ “How did you avoid deployment failures?”

### Answer:

“We followed environment-based branching, automated testing, code quality checks, and approval-based deployments.

Kubernetes namespaces and separate pipelines ensured isolation across dev, test, UAT, and production.”

---

## 5️⃣ “What did you learn working in a DevOps team?”

### Answer:

“I learned how DevOps teams collaborate, divide responsibilities, review each other’s work, and handle production systems safely.

It gave me strong exposure to enterprise DevOps workflows and best practices.”
