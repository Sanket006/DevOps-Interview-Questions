## 🔍 Monitoring & Observability Interview Questions (1–30)

### 1. What is monitoring in DevOps?

Monitoring is the process of collecting, analyzing, and alerting on system metrics like CPU, memory, disk, network, and application health. It helps detect issues early, maintain availability, and ensure performance targets are met.

---

### 2. What is observability?

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system using metrics, logs, and traces. Unlike traditional monitoring, observability helps explain **why** a problem happened, not just **what** happened.

---

### 3. Difference between monitoring and observability?

Monitoring focuses on predefined metrics and alerts, while observability provides deeper insights using telemetry data to debug unknown or complex issues in distributed systems.

---

### 4. What are the three pillars of observability?

The three pillars are:

- **Metrics** – numerical data over time  
- **Logs** – detailed event records  
- **Traces** – request flow across services  

Together, they provide a complete system view.

---

### 5. What are metrics?

Metrics are numeric measurements collected at regular intervals, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, request latency, or error rates. They are lightweight and ideal for dashboards and alerts.

---

### 6. What are logs?

Logs are timestamped records of events generated by applications or systems. They provide detailed context and are useful for debugging and root cause analysis.

---

### 7. What is distributed tracing?

Distributed tracing tracks a request as it flows through multiple microservices. It helps identify bottlenecks, latency issues, and failures in distributed architectures.

---

### 8. What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting tool that collects metrics using a pull-based model. It stores time-series data and supports powerful queries using PromQL.

---

### 9. How does Prometheus collect metrics?

Prometheus scrapes metrics from HTTP endpoints (like `/metrics`) exposed by applications or exporters at regular intervals.

---

### 10. What is an exporter in Prometheus?

An exporter converts system or application metrics into a Prometheus-compatible format.  
**Example:** Node Exporter for OS-level metrics.

---

### 11. What is Grafana?

Grafana is a visualization tool used to create dashboards and charts from data sources like Prometheus, CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, and others.

---

### 12. What are alerts?

Alerts notify teams when metrics cross predefined thresholds, such as high CPU usage or increased error rates, allowing quick incident response.

---

### 13. What is Alertmanager?

Alertmanager handles alerts generated by Prometheus. It manages alert grouping, deduplication, silencing, and notification routing to email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.

---

### 14. What is SLA, SLO, and SLI?

- **SLI (Service Level Indicator):** Measurement (e.g., latency)  
- **SLO (Service Level Objective):** Target (e.g., 99.9% uptime)  
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** Contractual guarantee with penalties  

---

### 15. What is uptime monitoring?

Uptime monitoring checks whether a service is reachable and responding correctly, usually via HTTP or ping checks.

---

### 16. What is black-box vs white-box monitoring?

- **Black-box:** External monitoring (user perspective)  
- **White-box:** Internal metrics (CPU, memory, internal states)  

---

### 17. What is log aggregation?

Log aggregation collects logs from multiple sources into a centralized system for search, analysis, and troubleshooting.

---

### 18. What is ELK stack?

ELK stands for:

- **Elasticsearch:** Storage and search  
- **Logstash:** Log processing  
- **Kibana:** Visualization  

Used for centralized logging.

---

### 19. What is EFK stack?

EFK uses **Fluentd** instead of Logstash. It’s lighter and commonly used in Kubernetes environments.

---

### 20. How do you monitor Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is monitored using:

- Prometheus + Grafana  
- kube-state-metrics  
- Metrics Server  
- Logs via Fluentd or Loki  

---

### 21. What is Loki?

Loki is a log aggregation system by Grafana Labs. It indexes metadata instead of full log content, making it cost-efficient and scalable.

---

### 22. What is tracing tool you know?

Common tracing tools include **Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray, and OpenTelemetry**.

---

### 23. What is OpenTelemetry?

OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral framework for collecting metrics, logs, and traces. It standardizes observability data across tools.

---

### 24. What is anomaly detection?

Anomaly detection identifies unusual behavior in metrics using statistical or ML-based methods, helping detect issues not covered by static thresholds.

---

### 25. What is noise in alerts?

Alert noise occurs when too many alerts are triggered, causing alert fatigue. It’s reduced using proper thresholds, alert grouping, and silencing.

---

### 26. How do you reduce alert fatigue?

By:

- Defining meaningful alerts  
- Using SLO-based alerts  
- Grouping and deduplicating alerts  
- Removing non-actionable alerts  

---

### 27. What is synthetic monitoring?

Synthetic monitoring simulates user behavior using scripts to test application availability and performance proactively.

---

### 28. What is real user monitoring (RUM)?

RUM collects performance data from actual users’ browsers, giving insights into real-world user experience.

---

### 29. What is latency?

Latency is the time taken for a request to be processed and responded to. It’s a key performance metric in monitoring.

---

### 30. Why is observability important in microservices?

Microservices are distributed and complex. Observability helps trace requests, identify failures, understand dependencies, and quickly perform root cause analysis.

---

## 🔎 Monitoring & Observability Interview Questions (31–60)

### 31. What is time-series data?

Time-series data is data recorded at regular time intervals, such as CPU usage per minute or request count per second. Monitoring tools like Prometheus store metrics in time-series format.

---

### 32. What is PromQL?

PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is used to query and analyze metrics stored in Prometheus. It supports filtering, aggregation, rate calculations, and mathematical operations.

---

### 33. What is a scrape interval in Prometheus?

Scrape interval defines how often Prometheus collects metrics from targets. Short intervals give more detail but increase storage and load.
