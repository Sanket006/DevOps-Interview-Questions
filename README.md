## How to Use This Repository

- **Quick revision**: Open any `.md` file and skim questions before interviews.
- **Topic‑wise practice**: Pick the technology you want to revise (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) and go through its dedicated file.
- **Scenario‑based prep**: Use the scenario/troubleshooting files to practice real‑world style interview questions.
- **Search specific topics**: Use your editor’s search (or `rg/grep`) across the repo to find specific concepts (e.g., "autoscaling", "prometheus").

## Suggested Study Strategy

- **Phase 1 – Fundamentals**
  - Start with `50QA-linux.md`, `50QA-devops.md`, and `50QA-aws.md`.
  - Then cover `50QA-git-github.md` and `50Q&A-jenkins.md` for CI/CD.

- **Phase 2 – Tools & Platforms**
  - Revise `50QA-docker.md`, `50QA-kubernetes.md`, and `50QA-Terraform.md`.
  - Add `30QA-ansible.md` if you are applying for config‑management heavy roles.

- **Phase 3 – Monitoring & Observability**
  - Go through `50Q&A-cloudwatch-prometheus-grafana-datadog.md` and `50Q&A-monitoring-obervability.md`.

- **Phase 4 – Scenario & Troubleshooting**
  - Practice from all `real-world-secnario-based-*` and troubleshooting files.
  - Try to **answer first without looking**, then compare with the written answers.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of This Repo

- **Actively write answers**: Don’t just read—pause after each question and write or say your own answer first.
- **Flag weak areas**: Mark questions you couldn’t answer confidently and revisit them later.
- **Convert to flashcards**: Move key Q&A pairs into Anki/flashcards for spaced repetition.
- **Keep it updated**: Add your own notes, corrections, and company‑specific questions.

## Contributing / Customizing

This repo is primarily for **personal preparation**, but you can:

- Add new `.md` files for additional tools or cloud providers.
- Extend existing files with more Q&A or updated best practices.
- Split very large files into smaller topic‑wise files if that suits your workflow better.

If you later host this on GitHub and want to accept contributions:

- Add a section describing how others should format questions/answers.
- Optionally create a simple folder structure (e.g., `linux/`, `aws/`, `kubernetes/`) and link to them from this `README.md`.

Unless you add a specific license file, treat this as **personal study material**.  
If you plan to make it public, consider adding a `LICENSE` file (for example, MIT) and clarifying attribution expectations.
