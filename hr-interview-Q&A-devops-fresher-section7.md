## 🧩 SECTION 7: Situational Questions (Very Important)

### 1️⃣ If your teammate is not cooperating, what will you do?

If a teammate is not cooperating, I would first try to understand the reason calmly.

My approach would be:

* Have a one-on-one discussion
* Understand their perspective
* Clarify expectations and responsibilities
* Focus on project goals rather than personal issues

If the issue continues, I would escalate professionally to the team lead while maintaining respect and transparency.

### 2️⃣ If you miss a deadline, what will you do?

If I miss a deadline, I would:

* Inform my manager immediately
* Explain the reason honestly
* Provide a revised timeline
* Take responsibility without making excuses
* Ensure better planning next time

Accountability is important, and I believe transparent communication builds trust.

### 3️⃣ If you don’t understand a task, how will you proceed?

If I do not understand a task, I would:

* First review documentation
* Research the topic independently
* Break the task into smaller parts
* Ask clarifying questions to my manager or team if needed

I believe in attempting first, then asking informed questions rather than directly depending on others.

### 4️⃣ If you disagree with your manager, what will you do?

If I disagree, I would:

* Listen carefully to the manager’s viewpoint

I believe disagreements should be handled with respect and data-driven discussion.

If my script breaks in production, I would:

Mistakes can happen, but accountability and corrective action matter most.

Time management and communication are key during high workload situations.
