## 🎤 SECTION 9: Closing Questions

### 1️⃣ Do you have any questions for us?

Yes, I would like to ask a few questions:

* What does success look like for this role in the first 6 months?
* What kind of DevOps tools and cloud platforms does your team primarily use?
* Is there a structured learning or mentorship program for freshers?
* How does the team handle production incidents and post-mortem analysis?

These questions help me understand expectations, growth opportunities, and how I can contribute effectively.

---

### 2️⃣ Why should we not hire you?

If you are looking for someone with many years of production-level experience, I may not fit that requirement as I am a fresher.

However, if you are looking for someone who is:

* Highly motivated
* Quick to learn
* Technically curious
* Dedicated to long-term growth

Then I believe I would be a strong candidate.

---

### 3️⃣ What if we assign you a support role first?

I am open to starting in a support role if it helps me understand the system, infrastructure, and production environment better.

Support roles provide valuable exposure to:

* Real-time incident handling
* Monitoring tools
* Root cause analysis
* System stability practices

I see it as a learning opportunity rather than a limitation.

---

### 4️⃣ Are you comfortable working on weekends if required?

Yes, I understand that in DevOps roles, deployments or production issues may sometimes require weekend availability.

If the situation demands it, I am willing to contribute responsibly. At the same time, I believe in maintaining balance and planning efficiently to minimize repeated emergency situations.

---

### 5️⃣ Anything else you want to tell us?

Yes.

I would like to emphasize that I am genuinely passionate about DevOps and cloud technologies. I have transitioned from a non-IT background through consistent self-learning and hands-on practice.

I am looking for an organization where I can:

* Learn from experienced professionals
* Contribute meaningfully to projects
* Grow technically and professionally

I am ready to put in the effort required to become a valuable long-term asset to the organization.
